  <p>
    We have a date for the 2016 Randolph Ramble!
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Sunday, October 30th. Save it!</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Are we going to make it bigger, badder, and more extravagant than the first annual Randolph Ramble?
  </p>

  <p>
    Nope. We liked it just the way it was. Low-key. Fun. Rugged trail running. Great friends, new and old. Good food, too!

  <p>
    Save the weekend&#8211; we&#8217;ll be hosting the Trails in Motion film festival again this year, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the mean time, let&#8217;s all keep in mind some advice from participant Jeff LeBlanc:
  </p>

  <p class="text-center">
    <em>bang from loud cannonÂ </em><br />
    <em>does this uphill ever stop?</em><br />
    <em>wet leaves, rocks, don&#8217;t fall</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    And, oh, you can find lots of great photos from the 2015 Ramble <a href="https://www.facebook.com/randolphramblerace/?fref=nf">on our Facebook page</a>. Share the news&#8211; and until then, happy trail running!
